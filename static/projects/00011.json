    "extended_details": "Allow users to feel like they are engaging with a beautiful natural environment, using VR to place them in the space and real \"props\" such as grass and a stream to make the experience feel real, even when on campus.\r\nThe physical space consists of a small (6'x6') square of grass, with a running \"stream\" shaped into the square and some objects a user can pick up - a dowel, stones, a 'plant', etc.\r\nThe virtual space is similar to the physical one, but provides a more environmental experience with immersive sound and visuals. The dowel, rocks, & stream correspond to a stick, rocks, and a river in the virtual world, and the user can engage with each of these items. A Kinect tracks the current depth map of the environment - allowing us to have an accurate idea of where our interactive items are. Depending on the technology available to us, we will use either the Kinect or a Hillcrest sensor to track a user's hand and use of the objects.",
