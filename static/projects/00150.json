    "extended_details": "We disassembled the RC controller that came with the car, wired our Arduino into it, and sent commands through the Arduino to thereby control the car. Originally, we had planned to use a Jetson Nano, but since we encountered power supply issues with the Jetson, we decided to switch to an Arduino. Since we moved from Jetson Nano to Arduino, we also moved from camera to ultrasonic sensor since the Arduino has much, much less computing power. We also encountered issues with the LiDAR sensor, which we wouldn't be able to use with an Arduino anyways.",
