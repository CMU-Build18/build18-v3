    "extended_details": "The premise of our project was to bring the magic marble game, Gobstones, from Harry Potter to life by using electromagnets controlled by a stepper motor xy system similar to that of a 3D printer. We split our project into 3 main parts: the software, the mechanics, and the hardware. On the software side, we coded an app through python and CMU graphics to create the marble game on-screen. The play style is similar to that of Angry Birds, where you can click, drag, and release to decide your marbles' trajectory. Each player takes turns to shoot their marbles as close to the center \"snake pit\" as possible without falling in. Marbles that fall in are removed from the board. On the mechanics side, we cut and engraved a game board and 3D printed marbles in the Harry Potter house colors. We assembled our stepper motor system using aluminum rods, gear belts, and 3D-printed parts. On the hardware side, we calibrated the stepper motors and electromagnet accordingly with the game board using Arduino, breadboard circuits, and soldering. However, we ran into issues putting together these three parts into a full, cohesive game. That being said we are able to demonstrate the software and hardware components individually.",
