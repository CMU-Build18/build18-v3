    "extended_details": "As a CMU student, our sleep schedules are often disoriented and messy, often leaving us waking up still feeling groggy.

Waking up with our lamp simulates an environment akin to an amazing sunrise completed with a soothing ambiance. We analyze your personal circadian rhythm in addition to the essential sleep hormones such as cortisol and melatonin in order to personalize a sleep schedule that guarantees you a great night's sleep. This lamp helps you regulate your sleep cycle in beneficial ways to ensure that you are at peak performance each and every day. In addition, it can aid in relieving other sleep-related problems such as insomnia or jet-lag. So instead of having to worry about when to wake up, just focus on your work and let our lamp do the rest!",
