    "extended_details": "Push practice happens late in the night and often it is a battle against the elements. At times there are mistakes made in timing and this could be detrimental to the team when choosing or training their pushers. This project aims to leverage existing RFID/IR technology that is used in marathons and apply it to timing pushers.",
