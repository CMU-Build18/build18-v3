But for complex topics we might not get the proper intuition by just looking at a static picture. \r\n\r\nThis is where our project comes in!\r\n\r\nWe will convert hand drawn electrical circuits into a schematic by performing optical character recognition (with our model). A simulation is then run for the schematic to solve it and give a better intuition of the underlying concepts. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<strong>ECE major ? </strong>Take a hand drawn circuit, convert it into a schematic and simulate it.<br>\r\n\r\n<strong>CS major ?   </strong>Take a hand drawn graph, find the MST, DFS, BFS, etc. and visualize it step by step.<br>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis can be a great learning aid to students who might not have access to other proprietary tools and help professionals make quick and dirty simulations\r\n\r\nThe project can be extended as an AR application.",
