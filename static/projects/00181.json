While the human physically moves their chess pieces like in a typical game of chess, the AI moves the pieces without any human intervention \u2014 each piece is moved via an electromagnet attached to a gantry. A low-power circuit underneath the board keeps track of which pieces are where, including tracking the human\u2019s moves. \u201cChess Moves for Itself\u201d.",
