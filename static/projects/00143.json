    "extended_details": "The project\u2019s original purpose was using a ML, specifically a canny Edge model to create a drawing that a robotic arm can draw. Then creating almost a list of points that the robotic arm would then draw to. It would do this by moving on a sliding plate and would have around 5 degrees of freedom. What was actually done during build week was 3d printing most of the materials realizing that a lot of stuff didn\u2019t fit because I suck at cadding. The canny edge model and vectorization does work along with an image generating AI, that\u2019s hosted on a raspberry pi, However, our project ended looking like a jumbled mess of 3d printed parts and us wasting money printing some of them at tech spark.\n",
