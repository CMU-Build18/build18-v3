    "date": "2018",
    "detail": "Our solution to the last mile delivery problem - autonomous drones that deliver a package right to your door.",
    "extended_details": "We plan on building a small conceptual demo of what would be part of a larger autonomous delivery system. We will mount a computer vision system and package pickup claw to a standard drone in order to pickup and dropoff packages. Our system will be able to locate a colored packaged within a room, create a path to it, pick it up, and fly to another location with the package in hand - all completely autonomously.",
