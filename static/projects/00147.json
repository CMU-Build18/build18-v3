    "extended_details": "Purpose: to make playing music a more engaging experience by the inclusion of ferrofluid that dances to your favorite songs.\n\nHow the parts were used: The ESP-32 receives bluetooth signals from a mobile phone, analyzes the signal, and makes a ferrofluid oscillate to the music as per the song. It does so by generating a regular pattern of electromagnetic pulses, whilst also lighting up a NeoPixel LED marquee that provides artistic flair and ambient lighting. Concurrently, the ESP-32 controls transducers that play the music.\n\nImplementation: Audio amplifiers and transformers were used to guarantee good sound quality and overall design safety. The entire circuitry was bounded in a custom made bounding box.\n\nOverall Outcome: A custom designed box with a window to view the dancing ferrofluid and 2 outlets for the speaker. Box internally lined with LEDs, with the names of all builders engraved on the top-side opening of the box. Upon playing a song, the LEDs and ferrofluid instantaneously pulsate, and respond to stops and \"beat drops\" in the song.",
