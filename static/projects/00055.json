    "extended_details": "We will use the Particle prototype, and sensors that collect data relevant to weather analysing to build a module that can collect weather data, without ever running out of charge for years. Once data is collected, it will be sent to a server to be analysed. Multiple modules would be used in an area as a sensory array to provide more accurate and local on the spot weather data to meteorology centers worldwide. With enough sensors, a machine learning algorithm can be used to help predict weather in a certain area.",
