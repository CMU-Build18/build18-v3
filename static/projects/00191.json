Now you can with our state of the art\u2026\n\n\u2026force drone!\n\nOur project is to create a drone that can be controlled with one\u2019s hand. We\u2019ll use a motion  camera to identify which gestures the user is making with their hand and identify the position of the user's arm. If a user points their arm in a direction, the drone will fly in the direction the arm is pointing.\n\nThe drone will also feature a box that opens when the drone starts flying and closes when the drone lands inside.",
