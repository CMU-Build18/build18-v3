This robot will mix different quantities of liquids by using a pulley system and a stepper motor to move a cup between the suspended bottles. We will also incoporate a frother to mix the final drink. An iOS app will be designed to interface with an Aduino which will allow you to select the drink that you want to be made for you.",
