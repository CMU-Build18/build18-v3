    "detail": " We intend to build a cost-efficient 3D scanner that takes images of small objects and reconstructs them in 3D. The main physical components consist of a bottom plate to place the object and to help correct the camera, a small car with camera to move around to preset locations. The software component involves primarily the algorithm to reconstruct the 3D object from the 2D images",
