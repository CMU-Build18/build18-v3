    "extended_details": "Ping Pong Pickerupper is a robot that picks up ping pong balls. On the hardware side, the robot uses a 4-motor holonomic drive system with an intake, a 2D lidar for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and a camera for ball detection. Additionally, there are smaller components like L298N motor drivers, 9V batteries, and a power bank. All of the casing is laser cut wood, and finally, the robot's processing is powered by a Raspberry Pi 4.\n\nOn the Raspberry Pi, the operating system is Ubuntu 20.04, and the software being run uses Robot Operating System (ROS), which provides a framework for developing nodes for any aspect of the robot's actions. More information about the main nodes and what they do / how they work are below.",
