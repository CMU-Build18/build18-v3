    "extended_details": "We're making a robotic quarterback that identifies receivers and hits them with a perfect pass. This is a huge improvement over the current Juggs machine which only throws to stationary objects. It will use cameras to detect position of players and control the motors to adjust for depth. We'll limit how far the machine can throw the ball so that Aaron Rodgers doesn't feel bad.",
