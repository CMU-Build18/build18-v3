    "extended_details": "We propose to build a system to write on white boards/ chalk boards without the need for human intervention. The system will essentially consist of two gliders, to horizontal and one vertical that can grasp a marker or a piece of chalk. The system then writes on the board as if being played as a movie. The notes/ content can either be scanned via a camera or entered via a pdf.",
