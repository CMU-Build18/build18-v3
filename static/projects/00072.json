    "extended_details": "Developing countries are getting access to smart phones before they get access to clean water.  With low-power, low-cost sensors a smart phone can  take all the measurements needed to establish that a water sample or surrounding air is safe or dangerous.  I plan on reading the sensor data in, processing it in iOS, and communicating it to the user with the iPhone API.",
