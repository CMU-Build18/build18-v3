    "detail": "Lanternflies are a pest that damage the local ecosystem and are a bother to Pittsburgh residents. We aim to create an auto-detecting pressure washer turret system to shoot and kill spotted lanternflies called Lanternfly Air Defense System (LADS). LADS will detect flying lantern flies and shoot it with a white vinegar and water mixture through a pressure washer. It will detect lanternflies using 2 cameras mounted on the turret running a machine learning detection program. When a lanternfly is detected, the turret will then turn towards the lanternfly and fire.",
